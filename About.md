Introduction
YelpCamp is a multi-user web app that I made to explore the power of Node.js, Express, MongoDB and npm packages. 
This app features secured user signup and login functions and allows logged-in users to post, edit and delete campgrounds.
Users can also post, edit and delete comments for each campground.
